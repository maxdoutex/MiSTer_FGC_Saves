# MiSTer_FGC_Saves
A ready to use pack of Saves to have easier Versus Play for *(Mostly)* Fighting Games on the MiSTer.

### Saves
A set of GBA Saves for full unlocks of multiplayer games.
The saves have been converted into saves for the GBA2P core.
- Copy the GBA and GBA2P Folders to your saves folder to use


*Planning to expand to cover other consoles as needed*

### Script
Please add the below line of code to your downloader.ini file if you would like to have your MiSTer automatically download these files, and any updates when they occur.

**If you have an existing save file of the game the updated WILL NOT overwrite it. If you still want to download the save please backup/rename/remove your previous save.**

**If a save is not working ensure that the Game Name is matching the Save. I have used names provided by the HTGDB.**

### Thanks
Thank you **Theypsilon** for making the change to the updater to allow for saves to be distributed and just generally maintaining such an easy to use updater.

Thank you to **FPGAzumSpass** for your development of various cores, but especially the GBA2P core.
So many multiplayer games have become accessible thanks to this core, allowing more people to experience games they otherwise would never have played.

Thank you to the users of **Zophars Domain** and **GameFAQs**. 
Many people have put in work to share to GBA Save files and it's great to have easy access to all characters in various fighting games.
Specific users from these 2 communities are credited in the [GBA_Credits](GBA_Credits.txt) file.
If for any reason you would like to have your save removed from the Pack please contact me.
